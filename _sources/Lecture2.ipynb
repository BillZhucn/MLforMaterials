    "\n",
    "Hello again!\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity aims to build your understanding of using Python for materials modelling. It will require you to think back to undergraduate lectures on crystallography and materials chemistry. You are encouraged to look up concepts that you are not familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the computational materials science package `pymatgen` (https://pymatgen.org). Many Python packages have `py` at the start of their name. This one is useful to manipulate materials through its application programming interface (API). It also allows you to efficiently access and analyse the crystal structures and calculated properties that are available on [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical electrostatic interaction between point charges is described by Coulomb's law. For two interacting ions with charge $q$ and distance $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon_0$, the electrostatic energy is defined in the usual way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    E(r) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{q^2}{r}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the repeating unit cells, the electrostatic energy of a crystal composed of ions is more complicated to compute. Here, the electrostatic energy is defined by a conditionally convergent series. The number of charges grows with the square of the radius used for the summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/2_sum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ewald summation is a numerical technique to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of a crystal. The mathematical trick used is to split the electrostatic summation into real space and Fourier (reciprocal) space terms to ensure convergence at both short and long ranges. The technical background isn't important now, but is detailed over [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewald_summation) if you are curious. The corresponding expression can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{\\text{Ewald}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\neq j}^{N} q_i q_j \\Bigg[\\frac{\\text{erf}(\\alpha r_{ij})}{r_{ij}} + \\frac{\\text{erfc}(\\alpha r_{ij})}{\\kappa^2} \\exp\\Bigg(-\\frac{\\kappa^2 r_{ij}^2}{4}\\Bigg)\\Bigg] + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i^2 \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, we don't have to solve such an expression by hand. Within `pymatgen`, the `pymatgen.analysis.ewald` module contains the `EwaldSummation` class that enables us to compute the electrostatic energy for any given structure and will be used later."
