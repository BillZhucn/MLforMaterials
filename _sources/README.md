# Machine Learning for Materials

A practical machine learning course for materials science students in the Department of Materials at Imperial College London.

You have the option to browse the files or download the complete folder using the green `clone or download` button on the top right of the screen ([zip file](https://github.com/aronwalsh/MLforMaterials/archive/master.zip)).

## Course Description

_Machine Learning for Materials_ provides an introduction to statistical research tools for materials theory and simulation. It is aimed at senior undergraduate or junior postgraduate students. 

You will consider how composition-structure-property information in materials science can be represented in a form suitable for machine learning. You will then build, train, and evaluate your own models using public tools and open datasets. 

A hybrid teaching style will be followed with a mixture of lectures and assignments. The course assumes a basic working knowledge of the Python 3 programming language.
